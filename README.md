# braingrowthFEniCS
 2D/3D FEniCS-based model to investigate brain growth-induced folding process
 
## Presentation
- brain growth mechanics model developped with FEniCS library
- Non linear elastodynamics (dynamics: consider high wave frequency model) 
- Discretization of spatial domain (FEM method) and temporal domain (generalized-alpha method)
- Non linear solver: "newton" -> for each timestep 'dt', the non-linear residual form F is minimized trough successive linear iterations, thanks to jacobian dF/du. And for each "linear" iteration, a linear solver is used ("direct" or "iterative")
- 2D and 3D separated codes to improve performance (avoid "if dimension == n" loops). But the architecture and parameters types are the same.

## Usage limits
- bilayer model
- traction considered as nul (but needs to be clarified)
- code not parallelized

## Still to be done
- optimize solver parameters
- fine tune parameters
- collisions management
- add 3D bock geometry
- add separatedvisualization package
- add metrics package including slam/Spangy
- "Errors" management
- gradient of layers / growth tensor
- simulation time / real time
